## 📚 Learning Goals

This project was created as part of my journey into front-end web development. Through this website, I aimed to:

* Understand how Bootstrap’s grid system works
* Implement responsive designs easily
* Practice using common Bootstrap components (navbars, carousels, cards, forms)
* Minimize use of custom CSS by relying on Bootstrap utility classes
